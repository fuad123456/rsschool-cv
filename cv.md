## Briefly About Myself:
Hello everyone, I want to tell you a little about myself. Since childhood, I dreamed, like other children in the world, to operate toy cars. But unfortunately, my dreams were not destined to come true ...

Now I had the opportunity to fulfill my dream again. Today we can control the computers that run the world and this is very cool!
I want to become a Senior Software Engineer, and on my way I am ready to overcome all kinds of difficulties associated with studying and developing my own skills.

Just as I coped with the beginning in the field of IT, I believe that in sha Allah, I will achieve my goal!
